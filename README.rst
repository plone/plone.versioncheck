=============================================================================
Checks pinned versions with overrides in a cascaded buildout
=============================================================================

**plone.versioncheck**

.. contents::

Features
========

1) **Checks buildouts ``[versions]`` sections** while stepping through the cascaded ``extends``

   - command line script collects the inherited version pins, remembers where a version pin comes from.
   - It displays the result in order to enable a human to check that pins and overrides are OK.
   - Output is colored; this helps to identify packages which have newer versions available.
   - Machine readable output as JSON on demand.

2) **Checks Python Package Index (PyPI)** for newer versions.

   - Detects if a newer major, minor or bugfix (or a prerelease) is available.

3) **Buildout extension** records the **current versions state** and **requirements**

   - versions state and requirements are written to a file,
   - versions from the file will be consumed by the command line tool
       - orphaned version pins are detected,
       - it shows which package pulled in another package as dependency.

It works best with `semantically <http://semver.org/>`_ and only with `syntactically <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#specifying-your-project-s-version>`_ correct version numbers!

Usage
=====

Install with your buildout
--------------------------

Add a section to install it as a script and add it as an extension to your builodut::

    [buildout]
    ...
    extensions =
        plone.versioncheck

    parts =
        ...
        ploneversioncheck
        ...

    ...

    [ploneversioncheck]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs = plone.versioncheck

    ...


Run buildout as usual.

Now a file ``.plone.versioncheck.tracked.json`` was generated in the buildout-directory.

This file will be used by ``bin/versioncheck`` to figure out which packages were finally used.

Run buildout again to regenerate this file.


commandline
-----------

::

    usage: versioncheck [-h] [-p] [-n] [-N] [-r] [-i] [-m] [--no-cache] [-b]
                        [--no-colors] [--debug-limit DEBUG_LIMIT]
                        [buildout]

    Fetch information about pinned versions and its overrides in simple and complex/cascaded buildouts.

    positional arguments:
      buildout              path to buildout.cfg or other *.cfg file

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -p, --pypi            check PyPI for newer versions
      -n, --newer           display only packages with newer version than active
      -N, --newer-orphaned  display orphaned packages only when newer versions
                            available
      -r, --required-by     show information about requirements (only if tracking
                            file is available)
      -i, --ignore-tracking
                            ignore tracking file (if present)
      -m, --machine         show as machine readable output (json)
      --no-cache            do not use a cache for PyPI
      -b, --browser         show as html for webbrowser
      --no-colors           do not show colors
      --debug-limit DEBUG_LIMIT
                            Limit the number of PyPI versions fetched for
                            debugging

    States and color codes:
      [A]ctive (white)
      [D]evelop (green)
      [O]rphaned (magenta)
      [I]nherited (older or same versions are gray, newer are yellow)
      [U]pdate of final release on PyPI available (cyan)
      [P]rerelease update on PyPI available (blue)
      [X] unpinned (red)
      [r] Requirement (gray)
      [a] Annotation (gray)

    Color of package name helps to indicate overall state of a package.



Files created
-------------

If the script was used with the ``--pypi`` option, a directory ``.plone.versioncheck.cache`` will be created.
It contains the cache of the requests to PyPI or external buildout configuration files.
To clear the cache, remove the directory.
The caching library uses the expiration headers of the response from PyPI, so even with cache it starts fetching new records.

If the extension was used, a file ``.plone.versioncheck.tracked.json`` will be created.
It contains the information from last buildout run.


Output explained
================

Legend of states and colors
---------------------------

[D]evelopment Egg
    A development egg is usually active.
    Description shows location.
    Color: Green

[A]ctive Pin
     Pinned version. Package is used and recent, all seems fine.
     Color: White

[I]nherited Pin
     Unused pin. If older than active, the pin color is gray; if newer, it is yellow.

[O]rphaned
    If tracked, it shows whether the package in the given configuration was used at all.
    Be careful with this information!
    I.e. in a development buildout file, other packages are used than in a live or continuous integration buildout!
    Color: Magenta

[X] Unpinnend
    Tracked, but no pin in ``[versions]`` sections were found.
    Color: Red

[U]pdate final release
    At PyPI there is a newer final version available (major, minor or bugfix).
    Descriptions shows on which level.
    Color: Cyan

[P]rerelease update
    At PyPI there is a newer prerelease version available (major, minor or bugfix).
    Descriptions shows on which level.
    Only if there is no final release update available.
    Color: Blue

[r] Required by
    If tracked and option ``--required-by`` was given, show packages this package is required by.
    Valid for current active/used version.
    Keep in mind this is based on the declared requirements, missing or implicit requirements are not covered.

[a] Annotation
    It is possible to annotate the reason why a version was chosen.
    The information is parsed out of a section ``[versionannotations]``.
    In this section  key is the name of the package and value the text annotations to be displayed.
    The value can span more than one line using indent (as usal).


Order of versions
-----------------

Order of versions is the buildout resolution order (how they are resolved by buildout in the extends chain/tree).
After that, the PyPI releases are shown (major, minor, pre, then the prereleases)

Example, given in each a version of ``my.pkg`` was declared:

1. ``buildout.cfg`` with ``my.pkg=3.0.3``

    1. ``buildout.cfg`` extends ``foo.cfg`` with ``my.pkg=3.0.1``
    2. ``buildout.cfg`` extends ``bar.cfg`` with ``my.pkg=2.0``

       2. ``foo cfg`` extends ``baz.cfg`` with ``my.pkg=3.1``

2. found a newer versions at pypi

    1. major ``my.pkg=4.0``
    2. minor ``my.pkg=3.2``
    3. major ``prerelease my.pkg=5.1b2``

Output looks like so::

    my.pkg
        3.0.3............... A buildout.cfg
        2.0 ................ I bar.cfg
        3.0.1 .............. I foo.cfg
        3.1 ................ I baz.cfg
        4.0 ................ U Major
        3.2 ................ U Minor
        5.1b2............... P Majorpre
